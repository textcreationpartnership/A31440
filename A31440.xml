            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

That <hi>preciſe ſignification</hi> of the word, and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription</hi> of the thing is before diſproved. The word properly ſignifies a <hi>ſeparation</hi> of a Body into <hi>parts,</hi> and is applyed both to <hi>political</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Bodies in the Scripture; as was proved above.

The word ſignifying indefinitely <hi>ſeperation,</hi> either in <hi>opinion,</hi> or <hi>parts,</hi> is it not a faire conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? <q>If ſeperation in judgement in a Church, be a Schiſm, much more upon that difference, to ſeparate from a Church, into another againſt the <hi>Church.</hi>

He now requires that it be <hi>called</hi> Schiſme in Scripture; when as before, he ſaid, if it had the <hi>nature</hi> of it, it was <hi>ſufficient.</hi> 5. If a bare <hi>Plea</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt corruptions, <hi>true or falſe,</hi> may warrant a <hi>ſeparation;</hi> then the moſt <hi>rigid
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:58403:39"/> ſeperatiſts</hi> may be, and are by him <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted</hi> from Schiſm; as I ſaid above.

His gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſon is, becauſe <q>The univerſal viſible Church we ſpeak of, is not a thing that hath, as ſuch, a ſpecificative form, from which it ſhould be ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as a particular hath for its ground of being ſo called.</q> That ſhall be tryed, when we hear what is the <hi>ſpecificative
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:58403:47"/> form</hi> of a <hi>particular</hi> Church. In the mean time, let us conſider why he denies this <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> to ſtand in relation to the particular Churches, as a <hi>Genus</hi> to its <hi>Species;</hi> 
                  <q>becauſe this would deprive every one of memberſhip in this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Church, which is not joyned actually to ſome particular Church, which is devoid of truth.</q> What force there is in this conſequence againſt them of <hi>New England,</hi> who make particular Churches to be <hi>Species</hi> of the <hi>univerſal</hi> Church,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey.</note> as (ſay they) <hi>ſeveral drops</hi> of water, are <hi>Species</hi> of water; and alſo make a man firſt a <hi>member</hi> of a particular Church, before he can be a <hi>member</hi> of the <hi>Catholick,</hi> I ſay, what <hi>force</hi> there is, in this conſequence againſt them, I do not ſee; I only note his <hi>diſagreement</hi> with them; though I agree with him in the thing. For the other, That <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> Churches are <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>Catholick,</hi> he alſo denies, becauſe, <q>this were to overthrow a remarkable difference,<note place="margin">

                  <note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> Vind.</note> But (beſides what others have ſaid, to prove the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> to be a <hi>Political</hi> Church, in a candid ſenſe) I would ſay, the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip only (or chiefly) was <hi>National;</hi> the <hi>moral</hi> worſhip was performed in ſeveral <hi>Congregations,</hi> or <hi>Synagogues,</hi> (wherein there were <hi>Rulers</hi> and <hi>ruled</hi>) and yet thoſe might be called <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, as a <hi>Totum,</hi> or whole. And why <hi>particular</hi> Churches may not be called <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>Catholick</hi> (which is but the <hi>National</hi> Church enlarged) I yet ſee no reaſon. That all the <hi>members</hi> of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Church</hi> ſhould meet together, to <hi>hear one Sermon,</hi> to <hi>partake</hi> of one <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c.</hi> as it was poſſible once, when their <hi>number</hi> was but an 120. <hi>Acts</hi> 1. ſo they are <hi>bound</hi> ſtill, but that the <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> makes it impoſſible.

                  <q>The formall reaſon
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58403:48"/> conſtituting a particular Church, is, their joyning together, in the ſame numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Ordinances for Gods worſhip.</q> It is true indeed, the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> as now it is enlarged hath not the ſame <hi>ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation form:</hi> For whether it be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red as a <hi>Genus</hi> or as a <hi>Totum,</hi> it cannot have the <hi>ſame form,</hi> with the <hi>Species,</hi> or <hi>parts.</hi> But if it have another <hi>ſpecificative form</hi> of its own it may from that be called an <hi>Univerſal</hi> Church; as well as a <hi>particular,</hi> from its form, may be called a <hi>particular</hi> Church. Why then is the Catholick called a Church Univerſal? <q>Becauſe all Chriſtians through the world, (excepting ſome individuals providential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excluded) do upon the enjoyment of the ſame preaching of the Word, the ſame Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments administred in Specie, profeſſe one common Faith, &amp; Hope.</q> The ſum is the <hi>ſpecificative form</hi> of the <hi>Catholick</hi> viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church (if it have any) is the <hi>profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>ſame Faith and Hope</hi> of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; whether the members enjoy the ſame Word and Sacraments, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred in Specie or no? And he needed not to have excepted any <hi>individualls providentially</hi> excluded from thoſe Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: for himſelf tells us an inſtance of a man, that never was partaker of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58403:49"/> thoſe Ordinances, and <q>yet a ſubject of Chriſts viſible Kingdom a member of this Church in the world, <hi>p. 139.</hi>
                  </q> And before that ſuppoſes, <q>A man may be instructed in the knowledge of the Goſpel, by the Scripture it ſelf, and make profeſſion of it, where he lives, though he be a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand miles diſtant from any particular Church, wherein the Ordinances are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, nor perhaps knows there is any ſuch Church in the world. <hi>p. 137.</hi>
                  </q> If then a <hi>joyning together</hi> in the ſame <hi>numerical</hi> Ordinances, be the <hi>ſpecificative form,</hi> of a particular Church, (of which more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>none) why may not the <hi>profeſſion of the ſame Faith,</hi> and hope of the Goſpel, be the <hi>ſpecificative form</hi> of the Catholick Church. The truth is, the <hi>Church</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the threefold notion, with the threefold <hi>differences,</hi> is not diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Species,</hi> or hath any ſuch <hi>ſpecificative</hi> forms; but is one and the ſame <hi>Church,</hi> conſidered in that threefold <hi>Notion,</hi> as the members may be conſidered, as 1. <hi>Believers.</hi> 2.

For his fourth reaſon he gives this, <q>The Apoſtles in planting of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, took care to leave none whom they converted, out of that Order, where it was poſſible, &amp;c.</q> But this is evidently falſe in the caſe of the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Unleſs where there were <hi>enow</hi> converted to make a Church.

How, or by what Act did God unchurch them? They did it themſelves meritoriouſly, by Apostacy and Idolatry, God legally by his Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Law of rejection of ſuch Churches.</q> But firſt if <hi>Idolatry</hi> and grievous <hi>Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> will merit an actual <hi>unchurching,</hi> not only the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> but they of <hi>Judah</hi> had deſerved it long before they were <hi>unchurched.</hi> And if <hi>Apostacy</hi> in a great meaſure will <hi>unchurch</hi> a people, <hi>England</hi> hath of late years <hi>Apostatiz'd</hi> ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently from our <hi>Ancient</hi> truths. 2. Where
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:58403:71"/> hath God inſtituted ſuch a <hi>Law,</hi> to reject a <hi>Church,</hi> preſently, ſo ſoon as it proves <hi>Idolatrous</hi> or <hi>Apoſtatical? Rome</hi> had not then been ſtanding at this day. 3. It is a queſtion, whether God ever <hi>abſolutely,</hi> unchurches a people, till he utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys them: as he did the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of old, and the whole <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> after <hi>Chriſts</hi> death: and the ſeven famous Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> ſince. 4. As alſo, it would be reſolved, when God did <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>church</hi> England, (which he <hi>inſinuates</hi> as granted) Whether whilſt it was <hi>Popiſh</hi> &amp; <hi>Antichriſtian,</hi> or ſince the <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> 5.

                  </q> Whence I would inferre, 1. That if the members of the inviſible or viſible Church Catholike do occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally meet together, in obſervation of the ſame numericall Ordinances of worſhip, then and there is found a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church; though no explicite conſent be paſſed by them, one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. 2. That the explicite conſent, they ſo much talke of, is not neceſſary by inſtitution of Chriſt to the forme or eſſence of a particular Church, (the implicite covenant of Chriſtianitie, binding them to ſuch performance, when and where it is poſſible) but is
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:58403:77"/> onely a prudentiall meanes, or bond, for the better tying of members toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for obſervance of the Ordinances, and to exerciſe mutuall duties of love, to one another, as hath been ſaid. But as I ſaid above, theſe are not three <hi>Churches</hi> differing <hi>ſpecifically,</hi> but a <hi>notionall</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of that <hi>one Church,</hi> or the members of it, as they may be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 1. As true <hi>believers,</hi> 2. As <hi>profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors</hi> of the ſame Faith; 3. As <hi>partakers</hi> of the ſame worſhip. Now its evident that one and the <hi>ſame perſon,</hi> may be all theſe, an <hi>inviſible believer,</hi> a <hi>viſible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,</hi> and a <hi>fellow worſhipper.</hi> As we uſe to ſay in <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> there is a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold life, <hi>vegetative, ſenſitive</hi> and <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall;</hi> which may be all three, in one man, &amp; yet but one man, or creature. So then the <hi>forme</hi> of a <hi>particular</hi> Church, (if it have any) is rather <hi>communion in</hi> the ſame <hi>numericall</hi> worſhip, than <hi>joynt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> to communicate in that worſhip: That <hi>conſent</hi> Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> makes not the <hi>forme</hi> of a particular Church, but the <hi>bond,</hi> to tye the members faſter toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to their <hi>publick and private</hi> duties among themſelves.
